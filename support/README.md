# Supporting tools

This directory contains various helper scripts.

The scripts directly in this directory are intended to be used by Mesos
developers on the command-line.

**To use the Python 3 version of these scripts, set the environment
variable `MESOS_SUPPORT_PYTHON` to `3` and run again the script
`support/build-virtualenv`.**
