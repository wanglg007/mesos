The latest Mesos release, 1.4.0, is now available for [download](/downloads). This release includes the following features and improvements:

  * [MESOS-5116](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-5116) -
  The `disk/xfs` isolator now supports the `--enforce_container_disk_quota` flag
  to efficiently measure disk usage without enforcing usage constraints. The
  previous implementation always enforced the quota even if the operator might
  not have wanted it.

  * [MESOS-6223](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6223) -
  With partition awareness, the agents are now allowed to reregister after they
  have been marked Unreachable. Thus, they can recover their agent ID after a
  host reboot. See docs/upgrades.md for details.

  * [MESOS-6375](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-6375) -
  *Experimental* Support for hierarchical resource
  allocation roles. Hierarchical roles allows delegation of resource
  allocation policies (i.e. fair sharing and quota) further down the
  hierarchy. For example, the "engineering" organization gets a 75%
  share of the resources, but it's up to the operators within the
  "engineering" organization to figure out how to fairly share between
  the "engineering/backend" team and the "engineering/frontend" team.
  The same delegation applies for quota. NOTE: There are known issues
  related to hierarchical roles (e.g. hierarchical quota allocation
  is not implemented and quota will be over-allocated if used with
  hierarchical roles, see: MESOS-7402) and thus it is not recommended
  for production usage at this time.

  * [MESOS-7418](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7418),
  [MESOS-7088](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7088) -
  File-based secrets are now supported for Mesos and Universal containerizer.
  A new SecretResolver module kind is introduced to fetch and resolve any
  secrets before they are made available to the tasks. Image-pull secrets are
  also supported for Docker registry credentials.

  * [MESOS-7477](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7477) -
  Linux ambient capabilites are now supported, so frameworks can run tasks that
  use ambient capabilites to grant limited additional privileged to tasks
  without the requirement for matching file-based capabilities.

  * [MESOS-7476](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7476),
  [MESOS-7671](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MESOS-7671) -
  Support for frameworks and operators specifying Linux bounding capabilities in
  order to limit the maximum privileges that a task may acquire.
